    <h3>What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating<br>
        the site that we should know about?</h3><br>
    <p>- The view in MVC architecture. I used style.css to personalise <br>
         the view of the assignment to make it more appealing and stylish.</p>
    
    <h3>Which parts did you have trouble with?</h3><br>
    <p>- The first part I had trouble with was the poststatusprocess.php, where<br>
    I used regex to validate the unique code for the status code. Figuring it the<br>
    the correct regex to for the status code and also the status itself.</p><br>
    <p>- The second part which took time to figure out was the searchstatusprocess,<br>
    especially implementing the SQL query required for the function to work</p><br><br>
   
    <h3>What would you like to do better next time?</h3>
    <p>- Maybe learn JavaScript to enhance ease of use and human interaction.</p><br>
    <p>- I would maybe add social media interaction to allow it to status <br>
        information to be posted in social media platform.</p><br><br>
    
    <h3>What reference/sources you have used to help you learn how to<br>
        create your website?</h3>
    <p> Online PHP Function : http://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/ </p><br>
    <p> This helps me debug php code while working on the assignment.</p><br><br>
    <p> Regex Testing : https://www.regextester.com/</p><br>
    <p> This helped me to test if the regex will validate the status code<br>
    and status correctly</p><br><br>
    
    <h3>What you have learnt along the way?</h3>
    <p> - Overall, I learned more about php and html coding the basics of input<br>
        validation, php coding and styling.</p>
